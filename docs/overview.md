# Product Overview

English | [简体中文](zh-CN/overview.md)

LoongSuite Pilot runs on a developer machine and collects telemetry from supported AI coding agents. It is designed for teams that need a consistent view of agent usage, model calls, tool activity, token consumption, and operational health without asking each agent to report in a different format.

## Core Capabilities

| Capability | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| Agent discovery | Detect installed supported agents from local paths and commands. |
| Collection deployment | Install hooks or plugins for supported agents, and watch local logs or session files when needed. |
| Activity normalization | Convert each agent's native events into one GenAI event schema. |
| Log reporting | Export normalized events to JSONL, SLS, or HTTP. |
| Trace reporting | Export GenAI conversations and tool activity as OTLP traces. |
| Token usage | Capture input, output, cache read, and cache creation tokens when the source agent exposes them. |
| Tool activity | Capture tool call names, arguments, results, durations, and errors when available. |
| Privacy controls | Disable message content capture per agent and mask secrets before output. |
| Runtime operations | Manage the background service, inspect status, use the built-in local dashboard, and rollback versions. |

### Documented Windows Agent Support

The general support table describes integration capabilities across Pilot and must not be interpreted as an operating-system compatibility matrix. The following agents are currently explicitly documented as supported on Windows:

| Agent | Windows Integration | Trace Export | Log Export | Token Usage | Conversation / Tool Calls | Requirement |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|------------|-------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Claude Code | Hook | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | — |
| Cursor | Hook | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | — |
| Qoder Work | Hook / local data source | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | User edition |
| Qoder CLI | Hook | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | — |
| Qoder IDE | Hook / local data source | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Qoder 1.10.0 or later, User edition |
| OpenCode | Plugin injection | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | — |
| WorkBuddy | Hook wakeup + local transcript | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | WorkBuddy Desktop 5.3.5.0; Windows 11 installed-product E2E |

Agents omitted from this table do not currently have an explicit Windows support statement; omission does not necessarily mean that the agent cannot run on Windows. This matrix follows the [Alibaba Cloud AI Coding Agent access guide](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/cms/cloudmonitor-2-0/ai-application-access-ai-coding-agent/). See [Installation](installation.md) for Windows prerequisites and setup.

### Factory Droid Data Path

Factory Droid support is gated to transcript schema v2, with exact local-log
enrichment explicitly gated to Droid `0.199.0` and `0.200.0`. Pilot treats the
transcript as the session/turn/tool source of truth, settings as aggregate
usage fallback, and a uniquely matched retained log record as optional
per-call token and timing enrichment. Hooks carry structural wakeup hints only
and coexist with user Hooks; polling remains the fallback. Droid's native OTLP
export is not the primary source for this integration.

Droid content always passes the complete `mode=all` masking plan before output.
Historical complete turns can be inspected with
`loongsuite-pilot droid replay <selector> --dry-run`. Exact historical per-call
tokens require the corresponding Droid logs to remain available. See
[Agent Configuration](agents.md#factory-droid-collection-and-replay) for the
source trust order and replay rules.

Because AgentLoop does not deduplicate matching trace/span IDs and the current
path lacks a shared live/replay outbox/receipt, `droid replay --execute` is
temporarily disabled and exits 1 before source or queue access. Dry-run remains
available with `liveProcessedSkipped`, `unsafeStateSkipped`, and detailed
eligibility reasons.

## Data Collected

Pilot focuses on activity that is useful for usage analysis, audit, and traceability:

- LLM requests and responses.
- User sessions, turns, and intermediate agent steps.
- Tool calls, tool results, tool duration, and tool errors.
- Token usage and cost-related fields when available.
- Model provider and model name.
- Git repository, branch, and current workspace root.
- Host and service metadata.
- Agent-specific extension fields when a source exposes additional context.

Message content, tool arguments, and tool results can contain sensitive information. These fields are documented as opt-in in the [Output Event Schema](output-event-schema.md), can be disabled per agent, and can be masked before export.

## Output Destinations

Pilot can fan out the same normalized event stream to multiple destinations:

| Destination | Typical Use |
|-------------|-------------|
| JSONL | Local backup, debugging, and simple offline inspection. |
| SLS | Centralized log analytics in Alibaba Cloud Log Service. |
| HTTP | Custom ingestion service or gateway. |
| OTLP Trace | Trace backend, APM, or GenAI observability platform. |

If no remote backend is configured, JSONL remains enabled by default so collected data is still visible locally.

OTLP routes use a local durable spool. Once a batch has been atomically written
and fsynced below `spool/otlp/v1`, retryable delivery failures survive process
restart and are retried at least once. That acknowledgment is local, not an
AgentLoop HTTP 2xx. Droid live collection waits for that local durable
acknowledgment before committing its transcript checkpoint or deleting hook
events, so a queue capacity or disk-write failure leaves the source eligible
for retry with the same deterministic IDs. Existing inputs that have not
adopted this acknowledgment contract may still have an earlier
source-to-spool crash window.

## Local Runtime

Default local data directory:

```text
~/.loongsuite-pilot/
```

Important files and directories:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config.json` | Main user configuration. |
| `agent-control.json` | Per-agent admission control: `on`, `off`, or `auto`. |
| `deployed-agents.json` | Records deployed hooks and plugins. |
| `hooks/` | Installed hook scripts. |
| `plugins/` | Installed plugin assets. |
| `logs/output/` | Local normalized JSONL output. |
| `logs/input-state.json` | Input offsets and checkpoints. |
| `logs/sls-failed-logs/` | Bounded SLS failure metadata for diagnosis; no failed payloads. |
| `spool/otlp/v1/` | Durable per-route OTLP pending and dead-letter items. |
| `versions/` and `current` | Versioned runtime layout used for updates and rollback. |
